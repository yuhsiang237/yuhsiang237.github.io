Since I chose the job of software engineer to work, it has been four years. But sometimes I'm still not satisfied because every day is very regular.

### After I Get Off Work And Back Home

In four years, when I get off work, I will open the video game to rest, such as BloodBorne, Dark Souls III and Monster Hunter: World. I have no idea, but they can let me reflect on myself. Other times I just listen to hip hop music or rap or paint something.

I usually think about what I should do, but my skills, acknowledgement of technique, or environment always restrict me. My mind told me I couldn’t integrate them. If I can't solve it, finally, I will just be a technical guy with no soul, which I don't want to see.

### I Need To Lit The Bonfire Of Life

Now I am starting to integrate my acknowledgement, focus on what I felt, and get out of my way like Dark Souls. I have to explore and fail to go ahead, and don't be afraid to try those paths.

I will try the following things:
1. Integrate my acknowledgement to explore what I want to do.
2. Don’t be afraid to try those paths of failing and risk.


Finally, I've to thanks to the Grammar Checker that corrected my grammar.

自從我選擇軟體工程師工作已經有四年之久，但有時候我仍然覺得不滿足，因為每天似乎都過得很規律。

### 當我結束工作回到家
在這四年間，當我下班了，回到家會打開電視遊樂器來放鬆，像是血源詛咒、暗黑靈魂3、魔物獵人世界。我沒有什麼特別想法，只是它們能夠讓我放鬆反思自己。其他時間則是聽嘻哈音樂或是饒舌，以及畫一些畫。

我時常在想我該怎麼做，但我的技能、技術認知、環境總是限制我。我內心總告訴我整合不了他們。如果我沒辦法解決掉這問題，最後，我可能就只會成為一個沒靈魂的科技宅，這是我不想見到的。

### 我需要點燃生命的篝火

從現在起我開始整合我的認知，專注在感受上，就像暗黑靈魂，走出一條自己的路。
我必須探索、失敗，從中前進，並且不膽怯嘗試那些路。
我會嘗試以下的事物:
1. 整合認知來開拓我想做的事
2. 不要膽怯嘗試那些失敗、有風險的路
