In the first half of 2022, I worked from Kaohsiang to Taipei, and then started a financial-related job, which is loan service, and I write code in C# and Typescript to code everyday.

However, in my rest time, I prepared for Toeic and learned English online cuz I thought it's a challenge for me and if I got it over, I could do more thing such as joining a game team, doing business or even playing the video game in full English that made me getting more interesting stuff in my life, but my listen of English still needed to improve.

In terms of living expenses, I just gained some money and improved my life. I thought the money was not very important, but actually I still needed it to live. I work just to improve my life quality and family environment.

Finally, I want to share a video. I think it's fun to explore and study the unknown things, and it can give you a different perspective.
